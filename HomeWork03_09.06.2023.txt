Subject: Questions about our Next Class and Homework File Attached

Dear Julia,

I am writing because I would like to clarify the situation regarding the next lesson.

Firstly, I have a couple of questions and I would appreciate your answer:

Could you please confirm the time and link to the Zoom conference? 
I want to ensure that I have the correct details and will be on time.
I would be appreciated if you write me what will be the next topic of the lesson? 
Itâ€™s important for me to prepare for the lesson, for a better understanding of the topic.

Additionally, I wanted to inform you that I have completed the homework and have attached the file to this email.

I look forward to your response regarding the questions and to discussing the homework.
If there's anything else you'd like to discuss or any additional information you require, please feel free to let me know.

Thank you for your attention, and I wish you a productive and successful day.

Best regards,
Sergey
